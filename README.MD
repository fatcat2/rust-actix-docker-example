# Rust-Actix-Docker

In here is a simple example on how to build an Actix-Web server for Docker.

The reason I'm writing this is that I had a lot of trouble doing this earlier, especially with Google Cloud Build. By writing this, the goal would be to find a way to help other people who want to deploy Google Cloud Run Actix Web containers and would like a simple explanation of what's going on.
